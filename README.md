# SoftwareRendererTest

A basic 3d renderer that doesn't use the GPU.
This project is an exercise for [FlareOS](https://github.com/FlurinBruehwiler/FlareOS) (a project where we try to run [a Minecraft Clone](https://github.com/FlurinBruehwiler/MinecraftInC) 
on a custom OS), because there we also have to do everything on the CPU and can't use
a Graphics API like OpenGL.
